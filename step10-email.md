# Free email setup on a domain
To receive emails on your domain, you need to set up an email server. This can be done using various methods, such as using a third-party service or setting up your own email server. Here, we will use cloudflare's email routing service, which allows you to receive emails on your domain without setting up your own email server.

## Set Up Email Routing with Cloudflare
1. Log in to your Cloudflare account and select your domain.
2. Go to the "Email" section in the dashboard.
3. Click on "Set up email routing".
4. Enter the email address you want to receive emails at (e.g. info@domain.com).
5. Set the destination email address where you want to receive the emails (e.g. your personal email address).
6. Click on "Save" to set up the email routing.
